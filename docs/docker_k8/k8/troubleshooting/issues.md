## Schr√∂dinger's Deployment

Always **labels** in the deployment when created would get the same match for the pods, which will forward traffic to the nodes. 
**Note**: you must also have the **same label configured for the service** as well to respond the traffic back. 

```yaml
kubectl get pods -l app=web
kubectl get svc -l app=web
kubectl get endpoints
```
