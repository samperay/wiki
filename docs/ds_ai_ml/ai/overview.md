## AI Overvierw 

- making intelligient machines especially computer programs that simulate human intelligience and decision making

e.g: self drivinf cars, recomendation engines from netwfils or ammazon

## ML Overvierw

algorithm is trained using historival data to make predictions on the new data.

### supervisor learning

algorithms(classic/regression) are trained to use labelled data. i.e raw data you annotate which will be provided to algorithm.

### unsupervisoed 

algorithms(Clustering/Association) are trained to use unlabelled data. i.e raw data you annotate which will be provided to algorithm.

### reinforcements

train algorith on trail and error approach.

## Deep learning and Artifical neural networks

Artifical neural networks - mimic the structure of human brain
Deep leanring - subset of ML, that focus on building artifical neural networks that can learn from data.
