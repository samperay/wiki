## clean code

It's code which is **readable and understandable**. Clean code should be concise and to the point therefore,
and you'll, for example, wanna avoid unintutive names, complex nestings or big code blocks.

You, can follow common best practices and patterns and also a bunch of concepts and rules, it should be fun
to write and to maintain code and with clean code, you ensure that maintaining can be fun because your code can be understood by others.

As a developer, you are the author of your code. And you wanna write it such that it's fun and easy to read and understand your code. That should be your goal
