## Design effective alerts

actionable critical alerts

**system based **is always on the user focus, where as **cause based** is always on the internal

## Incident response structure and response level

IMAG - Incident Management At Google - it would address the challenge

- Establish clear roles and responsibilities
- Porcess that scale with incident complexity

key principles

Incident severity levels

![incident_severity_levels](./images/incident_severity_levels.png)

Incident classification

**P levels** for incidents for immediate reponse

**Sev levels** - Categorizes incident by severity

## Blameless postmorterm cluture

instead of asking **who did **?, infact ask **what caused** the issue.. thats about blameless postmorterm.
