# About

This wiki is a personal knowledge base that captures ongoing learning in software engineering, DevOps/SRE, cloud, and system design. Notes are organized by topic and focused on practical references: concepts, diagrams, checklists, and implementation details.

## What this wiki includes

- Programming fundamentals and patterns (Python, Go, clean code)
- DevOps and platform tooling (Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD, Linux, monitoring)
- Reliability engineering (incident management, observability, chaos engineering)
- System design case studies and architecture notes
- Cloud and MLOps overviews

## Why it exists

The goal is to keep a durable, searchable set of notes for quick recall and continuous improvement, and to share learnings in a structured way.
