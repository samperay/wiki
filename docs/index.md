## Myself

I’m a DevOps and SRE with 14+ years of experience, currently working at IBM where I focus on SRE automation and internal platform engineering.

Over the last few years, I’ve been designing and building a Slack-based internal automation platform that streamlines incident management, warroom creation, GitHub workflows, and operational tasks. This reduced manual incident handling time from minutes to seconds and significantly improved operational efficiency.

My core strengths are infrastructure automation using Terraform, Kubernetes operations, CI/CD pipeline design, and building scalable automation systems in AWS and IBM Cloud.

Before this, I worked extensively in Linux infrastructure environments managing 300+ servers, implementing Ansible-based automation, security hardening, and performance optimization.

Overall, I specialize in reducing operational toil, improving reliability, and designing scalable systems with strong automation practices.

## Day2Day 

On a day-to-day basis, I work on enhancing and maintaining our internal SRE automation platform.

This includes developing new automation workflows in Python, improving existing Slack-based operational tools, integrating APIs like ServiceNow and GitHub, and ensuring the platform remains highly available and scalable.

I also monitor system health using Prometheus and Grafana dashboards, analyze logs when issues arise, and troubleshoot Kubernetes-based deployments.

A significant part of my work involves identifying repetitive operational tasks and converting them into automated workflows to reduce manual intervention and improve reliability.

Additionally, I collaborate with SRE and development teams during incidents, help with root cause analysis, and continuously improve system resilience through better monitoring and automation.
