IBM Cloud Schematics provides automation by offering declarative Terraform templates to ensure a desired provisioned cloud infrastructure. Native integration with Red Hat® Ansible extends configuration, management, and provisioning to software and applications and integrates with other IBM Cloud Services. 

## Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

IBM Schematics executes IaC as a service which includes open source Ansible and Terraform amongst others (Git and Helm). IaC automation is hosted as-a-Service in the cloud and when adopted as an approach improves consistency, quickens deployment, and reduces manual errors through its provisioning and automation.    

### Features and Key Capabilities

**Hosted terraform workspace**

Able to easily provision cloud resources, allowing for focus to be on deployment of applications, configuration management, and subsequent daily upkeep in an automated approach for speed, consistency, and time to value benefits.  

**Native ansible actions**

Easily install software packages and application code on infrastructure.

**Collaborative environment**

Deploy and iterate infrastructure automation processes easily as a team.

**Integrate security**

Integrates easily with IBM Cloud IAM, Key Protect, IBM Log Analysis cloud service, and IBM Cloud Monitoring.
