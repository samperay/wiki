- Ensures user interfaces are accessible and enhance the performance of the application
- Works in programming languages like JavaScript, Node.js, or frameworks such as React, Vue, or Angular
- Skilled in UI development technologies such as HTML, CSS, JSON, and API usage
- Understands back-end concerns

### Backend 

- Works with client-server architectures, networking protocols, application development, and databases
- Uses and develops RESTful APIs and web services
- Understands user and system requirements
- Develops using a combination of object-oriented and functional programming models
- Plans, analyzes, designs, and constructs databases
- Implements industry standards and best practices for database security and is capable of analyzing and - defining database and information security requirements
- Develops structured query language (SQL) queries, back-end database stored procedures, or NoSQL queries
- Works in programming languages like Ruby, Python, Java, Node.js, and server-side languages such as Go and Rust
- Understands front-end concerns

### Devsecops

- Works with development teams to enable a continuous integration environment that sustains high productivity levels and emphasizes defect-prevention techniques
- Ensures delivery pipeline from dev/test, staging, and production and performs A/B testing 
- Automates, measures, and optimizes the system performance and processes
- Designs and implements tools for automated deployment and monitoring of multiple environments
- Works with tools like Jenkins, Maven, Ant, Gradle, Chef, Puppet, Docker, UrbanCode, Tekton, Terraform, and Ansible

### QA test Developers

- Encourages application development that builds tests from the ground up
- Ensures the product is robust and failure scenarios are considered and refactored
- Collaborates with cross-functional team members on story development, from before definition through final  deployment
- Performs exploratory testing using industry-leading practices
- Discovers defects/bugs and works with coders and product owners to determine root cause and how to prevent similar issues from happening in the future
- Drives adoption of test automation - unit tests, integration tests, functional tests
